Welcome. I'm Satya Tanwar, author of this blog.

I'm currently a Lead Cloud Architect for FORGE within Humana Inc. I've held many different roles in IT, including Solution Architect, Technical Architect, and Integration Consultant. For updated information, please see my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/satyatanwar/) profile.

In addition to my professional experience, I hold Bachelor's degree(2014) in Information Technology and a Master's degree(2016) in Healthcare Informatics.  I live with my wife and 5-year-old son in Massachusetts. When not working, learning, or writing about new technologies, I am hiking a nearby trail with my wife and son or riding a bicycle with my son. I consider myself a seeker who believe we need to find the true purpose of life, and daily I spend some time to know the unknown that resides inside our silent mind.
