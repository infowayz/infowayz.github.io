 Welcome. I'm Satya Tanwar, author of this blog.

 I'm currently a Lead Cloud Architect for FORGE within Humana Inc. I've held many different roles in IT including Solution Architect, Technical Architect and Integration Consultant. For a full and updated information, please see my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/satyatanwar/) profile.

In addition to my technical experience, I hold Bachelor's degree(2014) in Information Technology and Master's degree(2016) in Healthcare Informatics.  I live with my wife and 5 year old son in Massachusetts. When not working, experimenting with, or writing about new cloud-native technologies I can often be found riding my HD Sportster 2007 or hiking a nice trail with my wife and son.

I consider myself a seeker who believe we need to find the true purpose of life. Everyday I spend some time to know the unknown that's hiding reside with us inside our silent mind.
