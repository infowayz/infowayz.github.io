Welcome!! :nerd_face: I'm Satya Tanwar, author of this blog.

I'm currently a Lead Cloud Architect with Humana Inc. I've held many roles in IT, including Solution Architect, Technical Architect, and Integration Consultant. For updated information, please see my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/satyatanwar/) profile.

In addition to my professional experience, I hold Bachelor's degree(2014) in Information Technology and a Master's degree(2016) in Healthcare Informatics.  I live with my wife and 5-year-old son in Massachusetts. When not working, learning, or writing about new technologies, I am hiking at a nearby trail with my wife and son or riding a bicycle with my son.

I consider myself a ***seeker*** who believe we need to find the ***true purpose of life***.
